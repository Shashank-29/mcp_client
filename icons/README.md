# Extension Icons

Place your extension icons here:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels  
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

## Quick Icon Creation

You can create simple icons using the `create-icons.html` file in the root directory:

1. Open `create-icons.html` in a browser
2. Icons will be automatically generated and downloaded
3. Move the downloaded icons to this `icons/` directory

## Alternative: Use an Image

You can also use any image editing tool to create icons:
- Use a robot emoji (🤖) or copilot-themed icon
- Ensure icons are square and match the required sizes
- Use a transparent or solid background

## Temporary Solution

If you don't have icons, the extension will still work but won't display an icon in the Chrome toolbar. You can use a simple colored square as a placeholder.
